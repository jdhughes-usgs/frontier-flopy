	abstract = {Summary
This work describes the application of a methodology designed to improve the representation of water surface profiles along open drain channels within the framework of regional groundwater modelling. The proposed methodology employs an iterative procedure that combines two public domain computational codes, MODFLOW and HEC-RAS. In spite of its known versatility, MODFLOW contains several limitations to reproduce elevation profiles of the free surface along open drain channels. The Drain Module available within MODFLOW simulates groundwater flow to open drain channels as a linear function of the difference between the hydraulic head in the aquifer and the hydraulic head in the drain, where it considers a static representation of water surface profiles along drains. The proposed methodology developed herein uses HEC-RAS, a one-dimensional (1D) computer code for open surface water calculations, to iteratively estimate hydraulic profiles along drain channels in order to improve the aquifer/drain interaction process. The approach is first validated with a simple closed analytical solution where it is shown that a Piccard iteration is enough to produce a numerically convergent and mass preserving solution. The methodology is then applied to the groundwater/surface water system of the Choele Choel Island, in the Patagonian region of Argentina. Smooth and realistic hydraulic profiles along drains are obtained while backwater effects are clearly represented.},

@article{twarakavi2008,
	abstract = {In the past, vadose zone processes in groundwater flow models were dramatically simplified (or even neglected) due to constraints on computational resources. The one-dimensional unsaturated flow package HYDRUS, recently developed for the groundwater model MODFLOW, was evaluated and compared with other contemporary modeling approaches used to characterize vadose zone effects in groundwater models. Being fully incorporated into the MODFLOW program, the HYDRUS package provides MODFLOW with recharge fluxes at the water table, while MODFLOW provides HYDRUS with the position of the groundwater table that is used as the bottom boundary condition in the package. The performance of the HYDRUS package was analyzed for three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a one-dimensional infiltration experiment; (ii) a two-dimensional water table recharge experiment; and (iii) a hypothetical regional-scale groundwater flow problem. The computational need and modeling efficiency of the HYDRUS package was compared with other relevant MODFLOW packages (VSF, UZF1, and REC-ET). For smaller scale problems (up to two dimensions), the VSF process and the HYDRUS and UZF1 packages performed comparably well in terms of modeling efficiency and simulation times. Because of the high computational demand, it was not feasible to use the VSF process on a typical personal computer for the hypothetical large-scale groundwater problem. The HYDRUS package provided a much more efficient alternative to VSF for this large-scale groundwater problem and could better account for vadose zone processes than the UZF1 and REC-ET packages. For large-scale groundwater problems, the HYDRUS package provides an optimal tradeoff between computational effort and accuracy of model simulations for coupled vadose zone--groundwater problems.},

@article{KIM20081,
	abstract = {Summary
This paper suggests a new approach for integrating the quasi-distributed watershed model, SWAT, with the fully-distributed ground-water model, MODFLOW. Since the SWAT model has semi-distributed features, its groundwater component does not consider distributed parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient. In generating a detailed representation of groundwater recharge, it is equally difficult to calculate the head distribution and the distributed pumping rate. In order to solve this problem a method is proposed whereby the characteristics of the hydrologic response units (HRUs) in the SWAT model are exchanged with cells in the MODFLOW model. By using this HRU--cell conversion interface, the distributed groundwater recharge rate and the groundwater evapotranspiration can be effectively simulated. By considering the interaction between the stream network and the aquifer to reflect boundary flow, the linkage is completed. For this purpose, the RIVER package in the MODFLOW model is used for river--aquifer interaction. This combined modeling is applied to the Musimcheon Basin in Korea. The application demonstrates that an integrated SWAT--MODFLOW is capable of simulating a spatio-temporal distribution of groundwater recharge rates, aquifer evapotranspiration and groundwater levels. It also enables an interaction between the saturated aquifer and channel reaches. This interaction played an important role in the generation of groundwater discharge in the basin, especially during the low flow period. The advanced water transfer method in SWAT--MODFLOW was successfully tested, and reproduced the distributed drawdown and reduced stream flow by pumping with multiple wells. Therefore, when considering discharge to streams, springs or marshes, the use of this model would be beneficial in planning for the sustainable development of groundwater.},

@article{hill1998,
	abstract = {Abstract Nonlinear regression was introduced to ground water modeling in the 1970s, but has been used very little to calibrate numerical models of complicated ground water systems. Apparently, nonlinear regression is thought by many to be incapable of addressing such complex problems. With what we believe to be the most complicated synthetic test case used for such a study, this work investigates using nonlinear regression in ground water model calibration. Results of the study fall into two categories. First, the study demonstrates how systematic use of a well designed nonlinear regression method can indicate the importance of different types of data and can lead to successive improvement of models and their parameterizations. Our method differs from previous methods presented in the ground water literature in that (1) weighting is more closely related to expected data errors than is usually the case; (2) defined diagnostic statistics allow for more effective evaluation of the available data, the model, and their interaction; and (3) prior information is used more cautiously. Second, our results challenge some commonly held beliefs about model calibration. For the test case considered, we show that (1) field measured values of hydraulic conductivity are not as directly applicable to models as their use in some geostatistical methods imply; (2) a unique model does not necessarily need to be identified to obtain accurate predictions; and (3) in the absence of obvious model bias, model error was normally distributed. The complexity of the test case involved implies that the methods used and conclusions drawn are likely to be powerful in practice.},

Component-based software engineering enables the integration of plug-and-play components, but significant additional challenges must be addressed in any specific domain in order to produce a usable development and simulation environment that also encourages contributions and adoption by entire communities. In this paper we describe the challenges in creating a coupling environment for Earth-surface process modeling and the innovative approach that we have developed to address them within the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System.},
